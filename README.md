# iOS

This repository contains code for the native iOS app that displays the [air partners web application](https://github.com/airpartners/aq-web-client) 
and includes some iOS-specific implementations for features like navigation. As we update the web app, we'll need to ensure that this app continues
to display the web app as expected and add iOS-specific features (like navigation, notifications, location services, etc.).

For more information about development and deployment, check out the [Getting Started guide in the wiki](https://github.com/airpartners/IOS/wiki/Getting-Started).
