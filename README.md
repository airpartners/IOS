# iOS

This repository contains code for the native iOS app that displays the [air partners web application](https://github.com/airpartners/aq-web-client) 
and includes some Android-specific content for releases. As we update the web app, we'll need to ensure that this app continues
to display the web app as expected and add android-specific features (like notifications, location services, etc.).

For more information about development and deployment, check out the [IOS app wiki](https://github.com/airpartners/IOS/wiki).
